# Attitude Determination Kalman Filter

This module contains a Kalman filter implementation and simulation of the rotation dynamics of solid bodies in 2D & 3D.

## Purpose of this module

This module is written to gain an understanding of how a Kalman filter for attitude estimation works.

## Unit Tests

There are unit tests for all the essential components.
To run the unit tests simply run the matlab command ```runtests```.
